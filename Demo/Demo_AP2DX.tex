\section{Introduction}
To present our work to our colleagues and the customer, we will do a demonstration and presentation. The presentation will be held on thursday the 30th of june in the morning, and the demonstration will be held in the afternoon. This document describes the content of the presentation and demonstration.

\section{Presentation}
During the presentation we will discuss the features of our robot controller and how they are implemented, focusing on the Mapper and Planner. Also, we will include information on how we did testing and setup a buildserver. This includes code examples of tests and a tour of our buildserver interface.

\section{Demonstration}
We think we can demonstrate visualisations of the sonar and laser range sensors. Further we hope we can demonstrate a robot that can map the enviroment autonomously.
