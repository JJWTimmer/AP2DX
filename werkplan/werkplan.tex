\section{Specification}
In this chapter you can find a list of the products that will be delivered
during the project Software Engineering and Distributed Applications (BINSEGA6). You can also find a description of the product and witch specifications it will comply to. 

\subsection{Work plan}
The work plan is the document you are reading now. The work plan will contain
design decisions, the project planning and specifications of the different
software components. Furthermore it will contain the information needed to start
the project. It will also function as guidance during the project. 

\subsection{Presentation}
We are going to present our finished software product on Thursday in week 26.
This will be done with the help of a slide show. The following subjects
are going to be discussed in this presentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item How did the development process go?
\item What can the software product do?
\item What canâ€™t the software product do?
\item What can be improved in future?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demonstration}
The demonstration is going to be given right after the presentation mentioned
above. The sole purpose of the demonstration is showing that our software works
correctly as specified in the delivered documents. We will be proving this by
running our software in different scenarios.

\subsection{Final report}
The final report is going to be the last delivered product. After a review with
the professor of the draft, we will use the given feedback to produce the final version of this product. You can find the following subjects 
in the final report: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Project goals
\item The development process
\item Software architecture and explanation of design decisions
\item Software manual
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AP2DX Software}
This is the actual software that has to be delivered. The goal of the software
is to use a robot to map an area. During the mapping the robot needs to avoid
obstacles and he has to constantly know where he is on the map. Further
requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The software needs to be distributed
\item Limited failsafe possibilities
\item It should run over a network or on one device
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components}
This section will discuss the components of the functional design seen in figure
\ref{fig:fd}
\subsubsection{Coordinator}
This module will coordinate data traffic between the USARSim engine and
our program. It distributes the data to several modules, as can be
seen in the diagram.
\subsubsection{Abstract Motor}
With this module, we maneuver the P2DX robot in the virtual world. We
can control two motors, one connected to the left wheel and one to the
right wheel. When a path is planned or a reflex kicks in, it sends a
command to the Abstract Motor module. This translate the given
commando to a series of operations we then apply to the virtual motors.
\subsubsection{Sensor}
The sensor module collects sensory data from the robot. This data is
checked and translated. If certain data crosses a critical level, a
command is sent to Reflex to prevent the robot from crashing. All
data is translated and sent to our Mapper.
\subsubsection{Reflex}
To prevent the robot from crashing, we implement a module that is
always checking the sensory data. When some critical level is reached (e.g. a
wall gets too close in front of our robot, or the motors try to turn, but the
wheels do not) we take action, thus preventing our robot from breaking. 
\subsubsection{Mapper}
To be able to plan routes and navigate through the environment, our robot should
be able to create a map. This map is a representation of its environment, based
on the sensory data the robot receives. This module will also be able to track
the robots location in this map, by using data from, for example, the wheel
sensors.
\subsubsection{Planner}
To be able to create a map, our robot
needs to plan a path to (and through) unknown regions. Our planner sends the
robot to new areas, while avoiding obstacles. The Planner also
calculates our current location in the environment and checks if our
location is on the path we want to follow. The Planner uses data from
the Sensor and from the Mapper.
