\subsection{Milestones}
This subsection will describe the milestones, and what deliverables we will provide. 

\subsubsection{Milestone \#1}
A list of deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
\boldItem{Drive around:} We want the program to be able to direct
the robot through the environment. We will not yet focus on the ability to
follow lines or walls.
\boldItem{Avoid collision:} The robot should be able to avoid collision with objects
and walls. It will stop, turn a random corner, and drive on. This way it will
cover most of the area without colliding.
\end{itemize}

Classes needed to be implemented for this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Co\"ordinator
\item Sensor
\item Reflexes
\item Motor
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Milestone \#2}
A list of deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
\boldItem{Avoid obstacles} The robot will be able to avoid the obstacles that
cross his path, in stead of stopping 
\end{itemize}
