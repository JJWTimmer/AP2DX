The architecture of AP2DX was well designed. What we thought off in the first week
was nearly exactly programmed when everything started to work (give or take a few
small details, which were easy to add). The framework is robust and more functionallity
can easily be added. For example; sensor message we do not use can be added in moments 
using the the specialized messages. What was programmed uses only a fraction of the 
capabilities of our framework.
